            <p class="quote">How might we visualize the Holy Ghost to grasp the depths of Black spirituality? - Kristin</p>
            <p>This question posed by Kristin became a pivotal moment in my understanding of photogrammetry. Initially, the technology seemed straightforward—essentially capturing sophisticated images. However, my perspective shifted dramatically during my fellowship, where I delved deeper into the layers of meaning and memory that this tool can preserve.</p>
            <p>I had the privilege of collaborating with Kristian, a PhD candidate whose research is intricately tied to her Guyanese heritage. Her focus on the cultural practice of "Nine Night"—a ritual to honor and send off the recently deceased into the spiritual realm—opened my eyes to the profound capabilities of photogrammetry. This tradition, rich with emotional and spiritual significance, offered a unique lens through which to view the technology.</p>
            <h2>Harnessing Memory and Space</h2>
            <p>Photogrammetry, in documenting the intricate details of spaces where rituals like Nine Night occur, helps in capturing the layered experiences of those who participate in and inherit these traditions. The technology does not merely archive the physical aspects but also opens a window to the lived experiences, the chants, the cries, and the laughter that imbue these spaces with meaning.</p>
            <h2>The Intersection of Time, Space, and Memory</h2>
            <p>Our exploration went beyond technical capabilities, delving into the philosophical realms of space, time, and memory. Why do certain spaces trigger such strong memories and feelings? How can capturing these spaces in three dimensions help us better understand and convey the spiritual and cultural dimensions of such events?</p>
            <p>In transforming spaces into immersive, explorable 3D environments, photogrammetry allows us to not just see but feel the presence of the past. It becomes a dynamic tool for storytelling and remembrance, bridging the gap between generations and helping to maintain a living connection to cultural and spiritual roots.</p>
