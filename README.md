# Hello World👋

Welcome to my portfolio! 🎨✨ Thank you for taking the time to explore the work I’ve done as part of AADHum’s Summer Undergraduate Fellowship program. This space reflects my growth, learning, and creative journey within AADHum, blending art, culture, and technology. Through this portfolio, I aim to share insights into my exploration of Black expressive life using digital tools and experimental methodologies.

## The Script: All About AADHum 📜

In this section, I reflect on AADHum's mission and how it creates a space for digital humanities that centers Black study. I explore how AADHum communicates its mission to diverse audiences, from high school students to loving elders, ensuring knowledge flows in ways that are relevant and accessible.

### What is AADHum? What Do We Do? 🤔
- **AADHum (African American Digital Humanities initiative)** uses digital tools and methodologies to explore Black expressive culture.
- The initiative is focused on making technology accessible and relevant to communities by developing strategies that meet people where they are.

### Our Programming 🗓️
- **Opportunities to get involved:** Engage in AADHum’s research labs, digital workshops, and fellowship programs to explore intersections of technology and Black Study.

### Collaborations 🤝
- **Past partnerships:** Examples include community-based collaborations and campus-wide initiatives aimed at integrating humanities with emerging digital practices.

### Professor Marisa Parham 👩‍🏫
- AADHum's Director, leading the charge in rethinking how digital humanities serve Black communities through creative and critical methodologies.

## AADHum Tour: Main Room 🏠

In the tour section, I guide you through the heart of AADHum’s space: the Main Room. This room is the epicenter of creativity and collaboration, where scholars, artists, and community members converge to explore Black life through digital tools. It’s a space where hands-on experimentation meets critical thought, inspiring connections between craft and code.

## Inventory: Technological Ecosystem of AADHum 🔧

AADHum's technological ecosystem intertwines art, culture, and digital tools, prompting us to ask: How do these technologies help us understand Black life and intellectual traditions? My curated collection focuses on technologies that evoke a sense of play and material engagement, exploring how they can be repurposed for Black expressive practices.

## Textile Mapping / Physical Computing 🧵💻

In this project, I mapped spaces of contested histories using textiles, threading together cultural narratives and computational design. Drawing on histories of weaving and braiding in Black communities, I explored how tactile computing creates new forms of storytelling. My textile is encoded with stories, both in its design and the computational code that animates it.

## Photogrammetry and 3D Rendered Environments 🖼️🌐

This section delves into the power of remembering through digital spaces. Using photogrammetry techniques, I transformed 2D data into immersive 3D environments, exploring how digital memory can create dialogue across time. This practice is not just about preserving spaces but about reanimating them, engaging with memory as a living, breathing archive.

## End of Fellowship Artifact 🎓

The artifact I created represents the culmination of my work this summer. It’s a product of research, making, and reflecting, drawing from the genealogies of Black expressive culture. Through this artifact, I’ve navigated the challenges of bridging scholarship and creative practice, leaving space for continued exploration and future iterations.

## Public Campaign 📢

As part of the AADHum Social Media Corps, I crafted posts that translate my work into public-facing content. These posts distill key learnings from each section of this portfolio and are designed to resonate with wider audiences, making digital humanities accessible and engaging.
