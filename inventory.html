      "Preface: There’s no fast-forward button, so sit tight. It's all part of the process. <blockquote>‘It’s all a part of the process.’ -Katelin Ten</blockquote>",
      "The AADHum Lab: It was all fun and games until my first assignment: Inventory. It felt daunting—accounting for every piece of technology, artwork, and miscellaneous item in the studio room.",
      "Labels, labels, labels—my initial instinct was to organize everything in sight, by first accounting for each item and then categorizing them to create what I thought was a more efficient landscape. However, my mentor, Katelin Ten, introduced a reverse strategy: understanding before labeling. This approach challenged my usual process, which had always seemed efficient and proven successful in the past. Why change what already works?",
      "It felt like being told to do an extra 15 sit-ups. Sure, they're beneficial in the long run, but I’m already in good shape, right? Despite my reservations, I embraced these 'extra' mental sit-ups, developing new neural pathways by approaching this project differently.",
      "Labeling second meant learning first. I began the tedious process of thoroughly accounting for every item, from a small Dongle Adapter for a stream controller to the large Snapmaker Artisan 3-in-1 3D Printer. Initially, I didn’t realize that understanding what things were and why they were there would help me grasp the bigger picture of their presence.",
      "I had labeled myself an outsider, encountering a pre-established system that dictated item placement. Instead of dismantling and rearranging everything to fit my memory, I began to explore, adopting an anti-colonizer mentality. This approach not only deepened my understanding of each item's purpose, location, and significance but also transformed me from an outsider into an engaged explorer and anti-colonizer. Consequently, the inventory transformed into an ecosystem, with me as its careful documenter.",
      "Sooo.. how do you feel? Are you upset that I took some of your time to read this the way I designed it, or are you glad for the space to engage with my journey in my own way?",
      "Welcome to my ecosystem."
