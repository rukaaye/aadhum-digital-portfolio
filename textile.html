        <h2>Welcome to Textile Computing</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the intersection of tradition and technology. Textile computing merges the rich heritage of textile arts with modern computational technology, creating interactive and smart textiles that are transforming fashion and design. This site explores my journey as a designer at the crossroads of Ethiopian cultural heritage and cutting-edge technology, where every thread tells a story of innovation and identity.</p>

        <h2>AADHum Highlights: Bridging Fashion and Digital Innovation</h2>
        <p>This experience stands out as a pivotal moment in my AADHum journey. Bringing together the physical and digital worlds through fashion has been a vision I've nurtured for months, solidifying my identity as a designer. The opportunity to finally merge these realms was both exciting and affirming of my creative direction.</p>

        <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello World. My name is Ruka, a first-generation Ethiopian-American and the eldest of five. I've always had the privilege of direct access to my culture. My earliest connection to my heritage was through music, followed by language, and then back to music videos. I was fascinated by the different outfits and jewelry each region would showcase. This was the foundation…

            Fast forward to today, I am a cultural contemporary designer specializing in Ethiopian culture and materials. I’ve learned to fully embrace both my Ethiopian and American identities. There were times when I felt conflicted about my American side because I longed to be fully connected to my African ancestors. However, AADHum helped me see the power and strength that lie within this duality. My strong foundation in my culture gave me the courage to create my own adaptations, which began gaining attention. This recognition encouraged me to further invest my intentions into this field, solidifying my purpose in this work.</p>

        <h2>Meet Dr.Liz</h2>
        <p>I was introduced to Liz before I was a part of AADHum, in a conversation she was hosting about Chicago and the different realities it has potentials for. Ngl, I was blown away and remember geekily saying something along the lines of “Your work about other realities opened my reality to a world of realities.” Long story short, she is so cool and was the great mind leading our workshop in textile computing.</p>

            <p>This microcontroller connects to a computer via conductive wires. The wires not only link the microcontroller to the computer but also bring your code to life on a touch-sensitive interface. By simply touching different parts of the microcontroller, you can activate various sections of your code, making the entire system interactive!</p>
